dotfiles
========


Installation
------------

### Prerequisites
* Git



### Bootstrapper


``` bash-session
$ bash < <( curl https://raw.github.com/supreetuf/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh )
```

Don't worry, all your old files will be backed up!


### Stay Updated

Run the bootstrapper again!

``` bash-session
$ ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```


Shell
-----

Most of the shell junk is setup to work in both zsh and bash. Bash users should
see [.bash_profile](https://github.com/supreetuf/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile)
and [.bash_prompt](https://github.com/supreetuf/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_prompt).
